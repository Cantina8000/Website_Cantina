<b>Cantina</b> is the name of a new artist-run exhibition space at Godsbanen in Aarhus. The exhibition space is run by the members of Corporum. 9 artists from Corporum is participating in the show.
<br><br>
The word <b>Cantina</b> is similar to "canteen" in etymology and derives from the Italian word for a cellar or vineyard. In Spain, a cantina is a bar located at a train station or near workplaces. This is where the workers meet during the lunch break or after dawn to enjoy food and drink while conversing and reflecting on the day. Similarly, the exhibition space Cantina, located at Godsbanen among art production, meeting rooms and studios, is a place where the creative environment can meet to reflect on art. <br><br>The exhibition <b>Just a sip - covered with a face</b> is the first exhibition at Cantina and thus also an opening party for the place and a celebration of the members who have established it. The title of the exhibition is inspired by a sonnet written by the Spanish author Francisco de Quevedo (1580-1645), in which he describes the Cantina as a place. <br><br>Just a sip - covered with a face gives a small taste of the members of Corporum and shows a selection of their individual practices.
<br><br>
The exhibition is curated by curator and artist Anna Bak.
